# Performance Optimization for Power BI Models

## Data Reduction Techniques

### 1. Remove Unnecessary Columns
- Only import columns needed for reporting
- Remove audit columns (CreatedBy, ModifiedDate) unless required
- Remove duplicate/redundant columns

```
column_operations(operation: "List", filter: { tableNames: ["Sales"] })
// Review and remove unneeded columns
```

### 2. Remove Unnecessary Rows
- Filter historical data to relevant period
- Exclude cancelled/void transactions if not needed
- Apply filters in Power Query (not in DAX)

### 3. Reduce Cardinality
High cardinality (many unique values) impacts:
- Model size
- Refresh time
- Query performance

**Solutions:**
| Column Type | Reduction Technique |
|-------------|---------------------|
| DateTime | Split into Date and Time columns |
| Decimal precision | Round to needed precision |
| Text with patterns | Extract common prefix/suffix |
| High-precision IDs | Use surrogate integer keys |

### 4. Optimize Data Types
| From | To | Benefit |
|------|-----|---------|
| DateTime | Date (if time not needed) | 8 bytes to 4 bytes |
| Decimal | Fixed Decimal | Better compression |
| Text with numbers | Whole Number | Much better compression |
| Long text | Shorter text | Reduces storage |

### 5. Group and Summarize
Pre-aggregate data when detail not needed:
- Daily instead of transactional
- Monthly instead of daily
- Consider aggregation tables for DirectQuery

## Column Optimization

### Prefer Power Query Columns Over Calculated Columns
| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| Power Query (M) | Can be computed at source, static values |
| Calculated Column (DAX) | Needs model relationships, dynamic logic |

Power Query columns:
- Load faster
- Compress better
- Use less memory

### Avoid Calculated Columns on Relationship Keys
DAX calculated columns in relationships:
- Cannot use indexes
- Generate complex SQL for DirectQuery
- Hurt performance significantly

**Use COMBINEVALUES for multi-column relationships:**
```dax
// If you must use calculated column for composite key
CompositeKey = COMBINEVALUES(",", [Country], [City])
```

### Set Appropriate Summarization
Prevent accidental aggregation of non-additive columns:
```
column_operations(
  operation: "Update",
  definitions: [{
    tableName: "Product",
    name: "UnitPrice",
    summarizeBy: "None"
  }]
)
```

## Relationship Optimization

### 1. Minimize Bidirectional Relationships
Each bidirectional relationship:
- Increases query complexity
- Can create ambiguous paths
- Reduces performance

### 2. Avoid Many-to-Many When Possible
Many-to-many relationships:
- Generate more complex queries
- Require more memory
- Can produce unexpected results

### 3. Reduce Relationship Cardinality
Keep relationship columns low cardinality:
- Use integer keys over text
- Consider higher-grain relationships

## DAX Optimization

### 1. Use Variables
```dax
// GOOD - Calculate once, use twice
Sales Growth =
VAR CurrentSales = [Total Sales]
VAR PriorSales = [PY Sales]
RETURN DIVIDE(CurrentSales - PriorSales, PriorSales)

// BAD - Recalculates [Total Sales] and [PY Sales]
Sales Growth =
DIVIDE([Total Sales] - [PY Sales], [PY Sales])
```

### 2. Avoid FILTER with Entire Tables
```dax
// BAD - Iterates entire table
Sales High Value =
CALCULATE([Total Sales], FILTER(Sales, Sales[Amount] > 1000))

// GOOD - Uses column reference
Sales High Value =
CALCULATE([Total Sales], Sales[Amount] > 1000)
```

### 3. Use KEEPFILTERS Appropriately
```dax
// Respects existing filters
Sales with Filter =
CALCULATE([Total Sales], KEEPFILTERS(Product[Category] = "Bikes"))
```

### 4. Prefer DIVIDE Over Division Operator
```dax
// GOOD - Handles divide by zero
Margin % = DIVIDE([Profit], [Sales])

// BAD - Errors on zero
Margin % = [Profit] / [Sales]
```

## DirectQuery Optimization

### 1. Minimize Columns and Tables
DirectQuery models:
- Query source for every visual
- Performance depends on source
- Minimize data retrieved

### 2. Avoid Complex Power Query Transformations
- Transforms become subqueries
- Native queries are faster
- Materialize at source when possible

### 3. Keep Measures Simple Initially
Complex DAX generates complex SQL:
- Start with basic aggregations
- Add complexity gradually
- Monitor query performance

### 4. Disable Auto Date/Time
For DirectQuery models, disable auto date/time:
- Creates hidden calculated tables
- Increases model complexity
- Use explicit date table instead

## Aggregations

### User-Defined Aggregations
Pre-aggregate fact tables for:
- Very large models (billions of rows)
- Hybrid DirectQuery/Import
- Common query patterns

```
table_operations(
  operation: "Create",
  definitions: [{
    name: "SalesAgg",
    mode: "Import",
    mExpression: "..."
  }]
)
```

## Performance Testing

### Use Performance Analyzer
1. Enable in Power BI Desktop
2. Start recording
3. Interact with visuals
4. Review DAX query times

### Monitor with DAX Studio
External tool for:
- Query timing
- Server timings
- Query plans
